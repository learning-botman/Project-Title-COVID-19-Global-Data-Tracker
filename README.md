# 🌍 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project explores the COVID-19 pandemic using the [Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases). It focuses on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of key metrics such as total cases, deaths, vaccinations, and trends across selected countries: **United States, India, and Brazil**.

## 📁 Project Structure


📦 finalprojectsample2.ipynb
📄 README.md
📊 owid-covid-data.csv


## ✅ Features

- Upload and load large datasets in Google Colab.
- Clean and filter data for selected countries.
- Handle missing values with proper techniques (e.g., interpolation).
- Convert and parse dates for time-series analysis.
- Visualize:
  - Total cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
  - Smoothed daily new cases.
  - Scatter plot: Vaccinations vs. Cases.
  - Interactive Choropleth Map using Plotly.

## 📊 Visualizations

- 📈 Line charts of total cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- 🔴 Smoothed trends of daily new cases
- 🗺️ Choropleth map of COVID-19 spread globally
- 🧪 Correlation heatmaps (optional)

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for static plots
- **Plotly Express** for interactive plots
- **Google Colab** as the development environment

## 🌐 Dataset

- Source: [OWID COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)
- File: `owid-covid-data.csv`

## 📌 Key Findings

- The United States reported the highest number of cases and vaccinations.
- India and Brazil had steep growth in cases with varied vaccination rates.
- Plotly maps revealed distinct geographic trends in virus spread and containment.
- Vaccination efforts show a positive correlation with lower case growth over time.
